1. ESP32 (MicroPython/Arduino) Sensors: GPS, accelerometer (or vibration sensor), optional actuators (relay, buzzer). WebSocket Client: Connects to FastAPI backend. What it does: Sends sensor data periodically (e.g., GPS every 2–5s, accelerometer only on events). Listens for commands from backend (e.g., “lock relay”, “sound buzzer”). Keeps payloads small for efficiency. 
2. FastAPI Backend WebSocket Server: Maintains persistent connections with ESP32 and Browser for sharing real time location of the vehicle. API Endpoints (optional): For receiving commands from HTTP clients, or storing historical events. What it does: Routes messages between ESP32 and browser dashboards. Sends telegram message if accident/theft detected through telegram api 
3. Browser / Dashboard Connects via WebSocket to FastAPI. Displays: Real-time vehicle location on Leaflet.js map. Status messages: Normal, Accident, Theft detected. Buttons to send commands to ESP32 (e.g., lock vehicle, trigger buzzer).
